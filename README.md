# SimpleString
Simple safe/dynamic string library for C. More functions will probably be added in the future.

To compile, just "make" at the command prompt.

./test_string to run

Notes:

	Remember to set your char* variables to NULL before calling safe_ functions.
	Remember to free() them when finished to prevent memory leaks.
